### 1. Defining Variables
variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout the script
- Variables are defined using the = operator, with no spaces around it.
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number.
```sh
name="John"
age=25
```
### 2. Accessing Variables
- To access the value of a variable, prefix its name with $
```sh
echo $name
echo $age
````
